As part of the Living Observatory Project, Researchers from the MIT Media Lab Responsive Environments Group installed a network of sensors at the wetlands near Plymouth Massachusetts. This website remixes the rich audio data from the sensor network to create a mindful sound experience and a forest animation that reacts to wildlife and weather activities in the wetlands.
